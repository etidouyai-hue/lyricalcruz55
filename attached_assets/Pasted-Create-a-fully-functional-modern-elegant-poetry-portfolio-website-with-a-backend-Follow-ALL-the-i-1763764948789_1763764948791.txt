Create a fully functional, modern, elegant poetry portfolio website with a backend.
Follow ALL the instructions below carefully and generate the complete project with all files.”


---

🎨 1. Overall Style & Design Requirements

Create a modern, minimal, elegant poetry website, inspired by:

Clean serif/mono typography

Soft grid layout

Warm neutral colors

Smooth scroll animations

Subtle parallax

Glassmorphism for cards

Idle cursor glow effect

Fade-in transitions on poems

Mobile-first responsive design


Think “literary magazine meets premium portfolio.”

Pages needed:

1. Home — hero + featured poems + categories


2. Poems Archive — list of all poems


3. Single Poem Page — full poem + like button + reviews


4. About Me


5. Contact


6. Admin Panel (moderate reviews)




---

🧱 2. Tech Stack

Use:

HTML, CSS, JS (no frameworks unless necessary)

Use modular JS (/js/*.js)

Use Supabase as backend

Use supabase-js v2 CDN

Use Edge Functions for secure anonymous posting

Use Supabase Auth for admin login

Use UUID for poem IDs


The final project must be easily hostable on:

Replit

Netlify

Vercel

GitHub Pages (with Netlify functions)



---

📦 3. Backend Requirements (Supabase)

Include everything needed:

Create the following tables:

likes

post_slug (text) PK

count (int, default 0)

updated_at (timestamptz)


reviews

id (uuid)

post_slug (text)

name (text)

email (text nullable)

rating (int)

comment (text)

created_at (timestamptz)


RPC for atomic like increment

Provide the SQL for:

increment_like(post_slug)

(Must be safe for concurrency.)


---

🔐 4. RLS Policies

Generate:

One dev mode (insecure)

One production mode (secure)

Auth required for admin panel

Public read

Anonymous write only through Edge Functions




---

⚙ 5. Edge Functions

Generate two Edge Functions:

1. submit-review

Accept name, rating, comment, post_slug

Rate-limit by IP

Validate inputs

Insert into reviews

Return JSON


2. increment-like

Secure atomic like increments

Must prevent multiple rapid likes from same IP

Return updated like count


Include complete code for both.


---

📲 6. Frontend Integration

Implement client-side JS that handles:

For Poem Pages

Load poem from /data/poems.json

Display poem title, date, poem body with line breaks

Show "Like" button

Display live like count (from Supabase)

Fetch & render reviews (from Supabase)

⭐ Star rating UI

Submit review form → calls Edge Function

Smooth transitions/animations

Anti-spam UI (disable button after click, loading state)


For All Pages

Animated navbar

Dark mode toggle + localStorage

Footer with social links



---

🧑‍💻 7. Admin Panel

Create /admin/index.html with:

Login (Supabase Auth email/password)

Table list of all reviews

Ability to delete a review

Ability to edit a review

Ability to view per-poem stats

Ability to manually adjust like counts

Minimal dashboard UI



---

📄 8. Data Structure

Create data/poems.json like:

[
  {
    "slug": "sunset-letters",
    "title": "Sunset Letters",
    "date": "2024-10-12",
    "category": "Love",
    "poem": [
      "The sky folds into its own warmth,",
      "like a secret being whispered back to fire.",
      "And your name—soft as dusk—",
      "becomes the color everything wants to be."
    ]
  },
  { ... }
]


---
